            <p>Hello! I'm Ankith [I go by Ankith101.rar or soul crusher 2005 on the internet], a 15 y/o highly interested in programming and computer science.</p>
            <p class="point_break">Python is my favourite programming language. Object-Oriented-Programming is cool. Web development is interesting too. Click here<br>Check out my GitHub account linked below to see what I'm working on.</p>
            <p>I've been sifting through many many text editors and IDEs trying to find the most suitable one for me. Right now, Vscode serves my needs just fine; micro for quick edits to single files (the fact that it runs in the terminal is legit awesome!) Speaking about terminals, Cygwin ftw.<br>My favourite themes are Gruvbox and Atom one dark. Favourite font? Fira Code ftw.</p>
            <p class="point_break">I've tried Vim and emacs, they have very weird default keybinds (its not like I can't configure it), the learning curve is too steep and I'm not usually a keyboard person, so it isn't the right one for me.</p>
            <p>Rise, fellow wannabe-Linux-users.</p>
            <p class="point_break">Nope, not employed yet, although.. I do like contributing to open source projects. Free and Open-source software is cool. Mad respect to Richard Stallman and the GNU project.</p>
